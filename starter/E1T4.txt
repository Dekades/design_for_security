# Poor practice 1

The business users should not be enabled to directly access the Secret Recipe Vault. An additional service like an internet Gateway with Authentication + Authorisation should be added to be able to monitor and controle the access

# Poor practice 2

All components that donÂ´t have to be in the public subnet shoudl be put into a private subnet, and least priviledge should be used to connect components betweem public and private subnet where needed.
