# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

The application instance should be moved to a private subnet to add extra security. Additional Certificates would also help, though would not limit the actual interface facing surface. 

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

In my opinion this wonÂ´t help, as long as the App-instance is still in the public VPC.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, only Data coming from the change of this settings onwards will be encrypted, but it could be manually encryptet with the same Keys.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All services deployed via IAC / so Cloudformatio or e.g. Terraform should only be managed via making changes there, and never manually.
I am not the expert with Cloudformation, but  the manually changed Components could be overwritten, and also the State/tracking  could get out of sync.
