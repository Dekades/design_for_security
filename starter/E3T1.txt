# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Even after running Hydra for more than 30 minutes + 15 minutes  no findings were showing  - see my screenshot for details. Probably the project setup is outdated which I cannot change.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

"Amazon GuardDuty continuously monitors and analyzes your AWS account and workload event data found in AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs"
So the brute force attach should have been noticed via the VPC Logs, but in this case it seemed to have failed to recognize.
